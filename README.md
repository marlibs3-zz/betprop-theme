# BetProp - a blog theme for betterproposals.io
This client required a pixel perfect recreation of their existing blog page for their business website as a WordPress theme. They wanted the theme to fit in with the rest of their website in terms of font, colouring, footers, etc. I was given the HTML and CSS files for the current website and I set out to re-create it as a theme.

## Development
Prior to this I had not written a WordPress theme before and this project was a real learning curve. I learned about WordPress' way of structuring their themes and how the post functionality works. From there on I created all the necessary files to complete all the required pages: main page, category pages, and single post pages. In addition I made an appropriate header and footer.

## Learning points
This was all prior to any formal coding eduction, so looking back on it it's a little all over the place. I really enjoyed learning how to make something that had so many separate pieces and then putting it together. It was interesting to work with a remote client who was in a different time zone, but this allowed for me to make executive decisions to go forward with the code.
